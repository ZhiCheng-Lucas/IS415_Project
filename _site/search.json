Convert to PCS to project since GCS is not appropriate for distance and area measurements.\n\nGeographical Coordinate Systems\nGCS define locations on the earth using a three-dimensional spherical surface. For example, WGS84.\nThey provides accuracy position information. Unit of measurement will be in either decimal degree or degree-minute-second format.\nGCS, however, are not appropriate for distance and area measurements. In this figure, it is clear that 1 degree distance at the north pole is relatively shorter than 1 degree at the equator.\n\n\nProjected Coordinate Systems (PCS)\nBased on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson.\nPCS provides consistent length and area measurement across space. Hence, it is important to transform a geospatial data from GCS to PCS before performing geospatial analysis."
