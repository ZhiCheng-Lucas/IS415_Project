General Notes. Placeholder for now.

GCS is the base. Convert to PCS to project since GCS is not appropriate for distance and area measurements.

### Geographical Coordinate Systems

GCS define locations on the earth using a three-dimensional spherical surface. For example, WGS84.

They provides accuracy position information. Unit of measurement will be in either decimal degree or degree-minute-second format.

GCS, however, are not appropriate for distance and area measurements. In this figure, it is clear that 1 degree distance at the north pole is relatively shorter than 1 degree at the equator.

### Projected Coordinate Systems (PCS)

Based on a map projection such as transverse Mercator, Albers equal area, or Robinson.

PCS provides consistent length and area measurement across space. Hence, it is important to transform a geospatial data from GCS to PCS before performing geospatial analysis.
